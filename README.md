My dotfiles.

## Notes

- List of installed homebrew packages and homebrew cask packages needs to be
  manually updated.

  Run:

  ```bash
  ./.list-brew-packages.sh
  ```

  Which will output two files:

  1. `~/.brewlist`; and
  2. `~/.brewcasklist`.

  These contain the installed packages and cask packages.
